# University Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a variety of data analysis projects that I performed during my time at Sokoine University of Agriculture. The projects span diverse areas of data science, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, statistical modeling, and machine learning. The aim is to demonstrate my growth and proficiency in applying data analysis techniques to a variety of problems.

## Projects Overview

The repository includes a wide range of projects that cover different aspects of data analysis. Here are the types of analyses included:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Projects involving raw data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Projects that focus on understanding and visualizing data to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and relationships.

3. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**
   - Projects where I perform hypothesis testing (both parametric and non-parametric) to draw inferences and test assumptions.

4. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Projects that involve building and evaluating machine learning models for classification, regression, and prediction tasks.

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Projects that focus on creating compelling visualizations to communicate data insights effectively.

6. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Projects analyzing time-dependent data, including forecasting trends and evaluating seasonal patterns.

7. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Projects that analyze text data to understand sentiments, opinions, and feedback using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

8. **Environmental Data Analysis**
   - Projects focused on analyzing environmental data to assess impacts of various factors on ecosystems and agriculture.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Libraries/Packages:**  
  - **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, NLTK, TensorFlow

## Project Structure

Each project is contained within its own folder. The structure is organized as follows:

```
/project-name/
  /data/                  # Raw and processed data files (CSV, Excel, etc.)
  /notebooks/             # Jupyter Notebooks with code and analysis
  /scripts/               # Python/R scripts for analysis
  /reports/               # Generated reports and results
  README.md               # Project description and instructions
```

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/university-analysis-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd university-analysis-projects
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (for Python):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open and explore the Jupyter notebooks or scripts to view the analysis.
